Title: Automatic Differentiation for Power System Analysis
Date: 2010-12-03 10:20

*This notebook calculates marginal loss factors of a power system using automatic differentiation.*

The marginal loss factor (MLF) at a connection node is defined as the rate of change of system generation at the reference node with respect to the change in load at the connection node. The reference node is defined arbitrarily.
That is, an MLF of >1 indicates that system losses as a ratio of total system load increase when load is added at that node.

Clearly, this can be approximately calculated by placing all slack generation at the reference node and slightly changing the load at the connection node.

However, if we represent the loads at all nodes of the system as a vector then we can write a simple function $P_{slack} = f(\vec{P}_{load})$ which takes as input the change to the power system loads (as a vector) and returns the resulting total slack bus power injection. **The gradient of this function will be the marginal loss factors of all nodes.**


## This Notebook

Below is code for calculating MLFs both using finite differences and through automatic differentiation with a custom Gauss-Seidel power flow implementation. A custom implementation is required to make it compatible with the `autograd` package.

Hopefully the Gauss-Seidel implementation is a useful standalone reference as a fairly compact numpy based implementation. I've found it's hard to find simple Python implementations. Note that it will probably fall apart if you put unexpected things in the pandapower network like constant impedance loads or buses that aren't numbered contiguously 0 through n.

To use this notebook first ``pip install -r requirements.txt``


```python
import pandapower as pp
import pandapower.networks as ppnw
import autograd.numpy as np
from autograd import grad
from copy import deepcopy
np.set_printoptions(formatter={'complexfloat': lambda x: "{0:.3f}".format(x),
                               'float_kind': lambda x: "{0:.3f}".format(x)})
```

# I. Finite Differences

To start with, MLFs can be calculated using a simple finite differences approach.
This simple approach serves as a baseline to establish what the expected results are.

Notably what we see is that bus 0 has an MLF of 1, because it's the slack bus.


```python
def fin_diff(f, x, eps=1e-6):
    """ Finite difference approximation of grad of function f. From JAX docs. """
    return np.array([(f(x + eps*v) - f(x - eps*v)) / (2*eps) for v in np.eye(len(x))])

    """ Calculate total slack generation with given load power changes.

    Args:
        load_p (iterable): Iterable of additional loads to add to network.

    net = deepcopy(net)
    pd2ppc = net._pd2ppc_lookups["bus"]  # Pandas bus num --> internal bus num.
    for b, extra_p in enumerate(load_p):
        pp.create_load(net, np.where(pd2ppc == b)[0][0], extra_p)
    pp.runpp(net, algorithm=algorithm)
    return net.res_ext_grid['p_mw'].sum()
```

# II. Automatic Differentiation
Here we define methods to perform a Guass-Seidel load flow using a pandapower network as the starting point.
The network structure is pulled from the pandapower network, as well as the pre-constructed ybus.

The Gauss-Seidel implementation is written to make it compatible with the ``autograd`` library.
The main restriction is ensuring that assignment into arrays is not performed.
e.g. ``x = np.array([...]); x[1] = 2`` is not permitted, as this is assigning the a value into the array.


```python
def init_v(net, n, pd2ppc):
    """ Initial bus voltage vector using generator voltage setpoints or 1j+0pu. """
    v = [0j + 1 for _ in range(n)]
    for r in net.gen.itertuples():
        v[pd2ppc[r.bus]] = r.vm_pu
    for r in net.ext_grid.itertuples():
        v[pd2ppc[r.bus]] = r.vm_pu * np.exp(1j * r.va_degree * np.pi / 180)
    return np.array(v, dtype=np.complex64)


def scheduled_p_q(net, n, pd2ppc):
    """ Return known per unit real and reactive power injected at each bus.
    Does not include slack real/reactive powers nor PV gen reactive power.

    psch, qsch = {b: 0 for b in range(n)}, {b: 0 for b in range(n)}
    for r in net.gen.itertuples():
        psch[pd2ppc[r.bus]] += r.p_mw / net.sn_mva
    for r in net.sgen.itertuples():
        psch[pd2ppc[r.bus]] += r.p_mw / net.sn_mva
        qsch[pd2ppc[r.bus]] += r.q_mvar / net.sn_mva
    for r in net.load.itertuples():
        psch[pd2ppc[r.bus]] -= r.p_mw / net.sn_mva
        qsch[pd2ppc[r.bus]] -= r.q_mvar / net.sn_mva
    return psch, qsch


def run_lf(load_p, net, tol=1e-9, comp_tol=1e-3, max_iter=10000):
    """ Perform Gauss-Seidel power flow on the given pandapower network.

    The ``load_p`` array is an iterable of additional real power load to add
    to each bus. By providing this as an input, this python function becomes
    the function ``slack_power = f(load_power)`` and thus the derivative of
    slack power with respect to load power can be calculated.

    By restricting the values of `load_p` to be very small we can ensure that
    this function is solving the load flow correctly by comparing it to the
    results in the pandapower network. Restricting to very small does not interfere
    with calculation of the derivative - that is, the derivative of
    x (the small value given as input) plus a constant (the load power specified
    in the pandapower network object) is equal to the derivative of x alone.

    Args:
        load_p (iterable): Iterable of very small values.
